Now that you've worked with Pintos and are becoming familiar with its infrastructure and thread package, **it's time to start working on the parts of the system that allow running user programs.**&#x20;

* **The base code already supports loading and running user programs, but no I/O or interactivity is possible.** In this project, you will enable programs to interact with the OS via system calls.
* You will be working out of the `userprog/` directory for this assignment, but you will also be interacting with almost every other part of Pintos. We will describe the relevant parts below.

**You can build project 2 on top of your project 1 submission** (dogfooding your own kernel changes like a product). Or **you can start fresh**.&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">**No code from project 1 is required for this assignment.**</mark> The "alarm clock" functionality may be useful in projects 3 and 4, but it is not strictly required.

You might find it useful to go back and reread how to run the tests (see section [Testing](../../getting-started/debug-and-test/testing.md)).
