In this assignment, we give you a minimally functional thread system. Your job is to extend the functionality of this system to gain a better understanding of synchronization problems.

You will be working primarily in the `threads/` directory for this assignment, with some work in the `devices/` directory on the side. Compilation should be done in the `threads/` directory.

Before you read the description of this project, you should read all the sections in `GETTING STARTED` and [C Standards](../../appendix/coding-standards.md) section. You should at least skim the previous four sections in [Code Guide](../../appendix/reference-guide/), especially [Synchronization](../../appendix/reference-guide/synchronization.md). To complete this project you will also need to read [4.4BSD Scheduler](broken-reference).

Here are the sections in this chapter:
