**By now you should have some familiarity with the inner workings of Pintos.**

* Your OS can properly handle multiple threads of execution with proper synchronization, and can load multiple user programs at once.
* However, the number and size of programs that can run is limited by the machine's main memory size. In this assignment, you will remove that limitation.

**Test programs from project 2 should also work with project 3.** You should take care to fix any bugs in your project 2 submission before you start work on project 3, because those bugs will most likely cause the same problems in project 3.

**You will continue to handle Pintos disks and file systems** **the same way you did in the previous assignment** (see section [Using the File System](../lab2-user-programs/background.md#using-the-file-system)).

**Here are the sections in this chapter:**
