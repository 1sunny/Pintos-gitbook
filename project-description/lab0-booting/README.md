**This assignment is set to prepare you for the later Pintos projects.** It will walk you through **what happens after a PC is powered on till when an operating system is up and running**, which you may have wondered about before.

* You will set up the development environment, learn the Pintos workflow, and run/debug it in QEMU and Bochs.
* You will then do a simple programming exercise to add a tiny kernel monitor to Pintos.
* Note that this assignment is much simpler than the remaining projects, because it is intentionally designed to help you warm up.
