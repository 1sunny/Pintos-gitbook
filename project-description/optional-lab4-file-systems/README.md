# (Optional) Lab4: File Systems

<mark style="color:red;background-color:red;">**Note: Lab 4 is not required for all the students**</mark><mark style="color:red;background-color:red;">.</mark>

**In the previous two assignments, you made extensive use of a file system without actually worrying about how it was implemented underneath.** For this last assignment, you will **improve the implementation of the file system**.

You will be working primarily in the `filesys/` directory.

**You may build project 4 on top of project 2 or project 3.**

* In either case, all of the functionality needed for project 2 must work in your filesys submission.
* If you build on project 3, then all of the project 3 functionality must work also, and you will need to edit `filesys/Make.vars` to **enable VM functionality**. You can receive up to 10% extra credit if you do enable VM.
